# Infinity AI - Biomechanics Evolution

Infinity AI is a sophisticated machine learning platform designed to analyze athletic biomechanics, detect muscle weaknesses, and prescribe corrective drills.

## Features
- **5GB Video Analysis**: Upload high-res footage for frame-by-frame biomechanical breakdown.
- **Self-Learning Core**: Background neural optimization ensures the model evolves over time.
- **Offline Capable**: Functions seamlessly without internet using heuristic fallback engines.
- **Secure**: Obfuscated core logic and honeypot protection against reverse engineering.

## Installation (Non-Technical Users)

We provide a simple "One-Click" installer for Windows and macOS.

1. **Windows**: 
   - Download `InfinityAI_Setup.exe` (from the app interface).
   - Double click to install.
   - The app will open in your default browser shell.

2. **Mac**:
   - Download the `.dmg` package.
   - Drag "Infinity AI" to your Applications folder.

## Installation (Developers / Linux)

For advanced users running from source:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. The application handles API keys internally.

## Security Note

This software contains active anti-tamper mechanisms. Attempting to reverse engineer the core logic may trigger security logs.

## Offline Mode

If no internet connection is detected, Infinity AI switches to **Simulation Mode**, providing analysis based on local heuristic patterns.
